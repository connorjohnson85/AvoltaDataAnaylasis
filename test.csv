God bless you all,

The family is in our prayers.

He was a Great man. Carried His mail for 23yrs Great Man Good Friend. Praying for y'all. Roy Green Uncle Jack was a giant of a man. Godly, kind, loving,  strong, and faithful. He will be missed greatly! Love you all, Cope family. Sending love to you all. I loved Jack and Pauline both. Jack is now singing in Heaven about our Savior. What a legacy they both left for us all. Cope Family: sorry to hear about the loss of Jack. You are in my thoughts and prayers. Cope family, so sorry to hear of Jack's passing.  He was always so nice.  We are related through my grandmother Carlettie Cope Cook.  Jack will be missed by all who knew him. Karen, Eddie and Family, we are so sorry about Jack. He was a wonderful man and great friend.  My daddy, Bob Moss  really enjoyed the talks, eating together and friendship he and Jack shared with each other while daddy was at Morningstar. Your in our thoughts and prayers. Love y’all. James and Teresa  Buchanan, Concord, NC When I think of Ochre Hill Church I can still see him and hear the clear, bass voice of Jack Cope.  In my mind the choir is still made up of Jack Cope, Uncle Berry, Delos Blanton, Lewis Olin Keener, Annie Bell and so many others long gone.  If there is a choir in heaven, Jack Cope has taken his rightful place as a lead Bass voice in that choir.  Sing on Jack, sing on forever. Such a sweet, faithful man!  Someone the world is going to miss!  God certainly has given an angel his wings!  Heaven will have a new bass singer (words from his long-time friend, Jerry)

","My prayers for Brandon and family
Here for a short time left a life time of memories.
God bless the family I named my son Bradley James in Brandon s honor... I have so many memories ... I wish I woulda texted him like I wanted to... I am so saddened that I couldnt be there... If anything is needed let me no please James, Brenda &amp; Abby,
My heart hurts for you all over the loss of Brandon, I pray God is covering each of you with a comfort only he can bring. Brandon was one of my closest childhood friends, and extra bonus as a neighbor and cousin. From the carefree days as children playing, bus rides and making our many forts, through high school and heartbreaks, he was always there. As adults our paths separated but on quite a few occasions he would sit with me as I waited for my kids at “our” bus stop, always ironic being the ones waiting for the bus instead of riding it. I have missed him and those times since we moved. He was a kind man, with a caring heart and an infectious laugh. I don’t think he ever met a stranger. I’m sure my story is like many others, Brandon meant a lot to a lot of people. Thank you for sharing your son and brother with all of us for these 31 years. God is keeping each of you close as you grieve this loss. 
With many prayers and love,
Kayla Wolfe My husband Clydeth has been working at Sol's creek cemetery this summer. Brandon would stop by every day and talk to him about work and how god Clydeth's work looked. Sending prayers, love, hugs, andhealing prayers to the family. Bea and Clydeth Brown You're all in our Thoughts and Prayers. May GOD bless and embrace all of you through these tragic times.. Keep The Faith!! My condolences to family and friends.
Brandon was important to me.  I have fond memories of coaching him in Football at Smoky Mountain High School and many talks about life.
